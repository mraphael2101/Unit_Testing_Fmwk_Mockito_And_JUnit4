/* JUnit theories are an alternative to JUnit's parameterized tests. A JUnit theory encapsulates 
 * the tester's understanding of an object's universal behavior. This means whatever a theory 
 * asserts is expected to be true for all data sets. Theories are useful for finding bugs in 
 * boundary-value cases. Theories are similar to parameterized testsâ€”both allow us to specify the 
 * test data outside of the test case. Parameterized tests are good but they have the following 
 * drawbacks: Parameters are declared as member variables. They pollute the test class and unnecessarily 
 * make the system complex. Parameters need to be passed to the single constructor or variables need to 
 * be annotated, simply making the class incomprehensible. Test data cannot be externalised */
